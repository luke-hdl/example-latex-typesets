# About
These are various TeX (mostly XeTeX) typesets I've done over the years. My work here is licensed under the GPL-3 General Public License; if, for some reason, this does not meet your needs, feel free to reach out to me at code@haunteddolllovers.net - this is really hobby stuff, anyways. 

# Projects 
## Sudoku
Example of how to draw a Sudoku puzzle without needing to pre-generate an image for it, appropriate for making puzzlebooks and the like. Includes a "sample" folder with a well-documented half-letter puzzle, as well as a slightly less documented "midori" folder, which includes TeX to generate sudoku booklets for the niche 8.25x4.5 Midori TN format. 

## Typeset Novels
Public-domain works and lorem ipsum, typeset for **XeTeX**. Note that some of the *fonts* in these files are more strictly licensed than the GPL-3 that I've applied to my own work. The licensing information is included in the attribution section of the TeX and PDF files. 

The Christmas Carol and Great Gatsby typesets are half-letter typesets and a decent starting point for anyone who wants to bookbind text work using a standard home printer. The Minibook typeset is designed to be used in conjunction with the Octavo option at https://momijizukamori.github.io/bookbinder-js/ - with this, you can take the tiny PDF pages produced by this TeX file and arrange them onto standard letter paper to be cut, folded, and sewn.

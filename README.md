# About
These are various LaTeX and XeTeX typesets I've done over the years. My work here is licensed under the GPL-3 General Public License; if, for some reason, this does not meet your needs, feel free to reach out to me at code@haunteddolllovers.net - this is really hobby stuff, anyways. 

# Projects 
## Sudoku
Example of how to draw a Sudoku puzzle without needing to pre-generate an image for it, appropriate for making puzzlebooks and the like. 

## Typeset Novels
Public-domain works, typeset for **XeTeX**. Note that some of the *fonts* in these files are more strictly licensed than the GPL-3 that I've applied to my own work. The licensing information is included in the attribution section of the TeX and PDF files. 

These are currently all in half-letter, but adjusting stock size is very easy in LaTeX, so these could be a good starting point for converting a novel for KDP, for instance. 

## Midori Traveler's Notebook Inserts
Inserts for the 4.5x8.25 "Midori Traveler's Notebook Regular" size. Includes: 
### Sudoku
This is pretty much the above Sudoku project, but it's Midori-sized, and includes a script to convert a whole insert's worth of puzzles into a single .tex file.
